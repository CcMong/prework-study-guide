# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The main reason budding web developers attend bootcamps is to receive all the necessary information they need to be industry-ready, as quickly as possible. This means they have to learn a lot of material, most of it new, in a short space of time. As a result, many of them feel overwhelmed and are sometimes unable to successfully get through these bootcamps.

This Prework Study Guide was built to help overcome this overwhelm. It contains concise study notes on the main cornerstones of web development - HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript.
