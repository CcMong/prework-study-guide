        <h2>HTML</h2>

        <ul>

          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>

          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>

          <li>Heading tags go from h1 to h6. Only one h1 tag allowed.</li>

          <li>The p element is used to wrap a paragraph or block of text.</li>

          <li>The img element can contain many attributes, but most important is src.</li>

          <li>The src attribute indicates the location of the image file.</li>

          <li>Semantic elements indicate the role of their content, and provide content structure.</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>CSS</h2>

        <ul>

          <li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) give the webpage content style.</li>

          <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen.</li>

          <li>Three ways to style a webpage are Inline CSS, Internal Style Sheet, and External Style Sheet.</li>

          <li>External CSS makes it possible to alter the look of a webpage by changing just one file.</li>

          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>

          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>

          <li>We can style elements by using the elements as selectors, or using the class attribute as a selector.</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>

        <ul>

          <li>Git is an open source version control system.</li>

          <li>Git allows multiple developers to work asynchronously on a project.</li>

          <li>Developers work on branches, which can be merged into the main branch after review.</li>

          <li>git status: Checks which branch we are currently on.</li>

          <li>git checkout main: Switches to the main branch.</li>

          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: Creates a new branch and switches to it. Best to use 'feature' prefix.</li>

          <li>git add -A: Adds all changes made to the staging area of Git.</li>

          <li>Once changes have been staged, we can commit our repo: git commit -m "YOUR MESSAGE"</li>

          <li>Make sure the branch is up to date before opening a pull request: git pull origin main</li>

          <li>Now push up all changes: git push origin branch-name</li>

          <li>Navigate to the GitHub repo and create a pull request. Note base branch (main) and compare branch.</li>

          <li>After review, we can merge the changes into the main branch and close the issue.</li>

          <li>Don't forget to update the local main branch. Navigate to the main branch: git checkout main</li>

          <li>Then pull the remote main branch into the local branch: git pull origin main</li>

          <li></li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>

        <ul>

          <li>JavaScript is the programming language of the web.</li>

          <li>JavaScript allows developers to program the behaviour of webpages.</li>

          <li>It is responsible for making webpages more responsive and interactive for users.</li>

          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>

          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>

          <li>A function is a set of instructions that tells a computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
          
          <li>Functions do not automatically run - they have to be called at the exact point of execution.</li>
